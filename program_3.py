# The Fast Freight Shipping Company charges the following rates:

# Weight    	Price Per Pound
# 2 pounds or less   	$1.50
# Over 2 pounds but not more than 6 pounds  	$3.00
# Over 6 pounds but not more than 10 pounds	$4.00
# Over 10 pounds	$4.75
# Write a program which calculates the shipping charge and displays the total.
